## [0.0.1] - 2015-02-17
### Changed
- Update year to match in every README example.
- Reluctantly stop making fun of Brits only, since most of the world
  writes dates in a strange way.

### Fixed
- Fix typos in recent README changes.
- Update outdated unreleased diff link.

### Added
- Link, and make it obvious that date format is ISO 8601.

### Removed
- Remove empty sections from CHANGELOG, they occupy too much space and
create too much noise in the file. People will have to assume that the
missing sections were intentionally left out because they contained no
notable changes.
